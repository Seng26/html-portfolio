<h1>SENG </h1> <!-- HAN TAN</h1> -->
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<a>A versatile Engineer with a Master’s degree in Electronics Engineering and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics and Mechanical Engineering, supported by over 4 years of combined industrial and academic R&D experience. 
   <br/> Currently working as an Internal Sales Support Engineer at a UK-based Heavy Copper PCB manufacturer, managing complex technical enquiries, multi-layer stack-up designs, and manufacturability assessments. 
   <br/>Additionally, I am developing JavaScript-based automation tools to optimize PCB data processing and production workflows as part of my company’s ERP system upgrade project.
   <br/>
    My academic background in vehicle dynamics modelling and MATLAB/Simulink simulation provides a strong foundation in system-level analysis,
    control systems, 
    <br/>and data interpretation—skills directly applicable to advanced navigation and inertial systems.
    <br/>
    <!--I am eager to contribute my multidisciplinary technical expertise and customer-facing experience to the Process Support Engineer position in Singapore, <br/>
    a role that closely aligns with the responsibilities as I currently perform in the UK—optimizing processes, resolving complex technical issues, and supporting customers to achieve reliable, high-quality outcomes.
    <br/> I am fully open to relocating to Singapore and available to move as soon as required.-->
